# "merge" defines how and when pull requests are merged. If the section is
# missing, bulldozer will consider all pull requests and use default settings.
merge:
  # "trigger" defines the set of pull requests considered by bulldozer. If
  # the section is missing, bulldozer considers all pull requests not excluded
  # by the ignore conditions.
  trigger:
    # Pull requests with any of these labels (case-insensitive) are added to
    # the trigger.
    labels: ["MERGE WHEN READY"]

  # "ignore" defines the set of pull request ignored by bulldozer. If the
  # section is missing, bulldozer considers all pull requests. It takes the
  # same keys as the "trigger" section.
  ignore:
    labels: ["DO NOT MERGE YET"]

  # "method" defines the merge method. The available options are "merge",
  # "rebase", "squash", and "ff-only".
  method: squash

  # "options" defines additional options for the individual merge methods.

    # "squash" options are only used when the merge method is "squash"
    squash:
      # "title" defines how the title of the commit message is created when
      # generating a squash commit. The options are "pull_request_title",
      # "first_commit_title", and "github_default_title". The default is
      # "pull_request_title".
      title: "pull_request_title"

      # "body" defines how the body of the commit message is created when
      # generating a squash commit. The options are "pull_request_body",
      # "summarize_commits", and "empty_body". The default is "empty_body".
      body: "pull_request_body"

      # If "body" is "pull_request_body", then the commit message will be the
      # part of the pull request body surrounded by "message_delimiter"
      # strings. This is disabled (empty string) by default.
      message_delimiter: ==COMMIT_MSG==

  # "required_statuses" is a list of additional status contexts that must pass
  # before bulldozer can merge a pull request. This is useful if you want to
  # require extra testing for automated merges, but not for manual merges.
