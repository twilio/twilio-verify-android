* Go to [Notify Services](https://www.twilio.com/console/notify/services)
* Create a `Notify service` for the app
* For `FCM CREDENTIAL SID`, select the created FCM credential
* Save changes
* Copy the notify service sid

### Create a verify service
* Get your account Sid and Auth Token from [API credentials](https://www.twilio.com/console/project/settings)
* Create a verify service calling the endpoint:
```
curl --user <Account Sid>:<Auth token> \ 
--request POST 'https://authy.twilio.com/v1/Services' \
--form 'FriendlyName=<The service name>' \
--form 'Push={
  "notify_service_sid": "<The notify service Sid>"
} 
'
```
* Copy the verify service Sid, it is the `sid` field in the response

### To run the sample backend
* Clone this repo: https://github.com/twilio/verify-push-sample-backend
* Run the steps in the [README file](https://github.com/twilio/verify-push-sample-backend/blob/sample-backend/README.md)
    * Use your previously created verify service Sid for `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID`

## Using the sample app

### Adding a factor
* Enter the public URL generated in JWT url

### Sending a challenge
* Go to [Create Push Challenge](http://localhost:3000/challenge)
* Enter the entity `identity` you used in factor creation
* Enter the `Factor Sid` you added
* Enter a `message`. You will see the message in the push notification and in the challenge view
* Enter details to the challenge. You will see them in the challenge view. You can add more details using the `Add more Details` button
* Press `Create challenge` button
* You will receive a push notification showing the challenge message in your device. 
* The app will show the challenge info below the factor information, in a `Challenge` section
* Approve or deny the challenge
* After the challenge is updated, you will see the challenge status in the backend's `Create Push Challenge` view
