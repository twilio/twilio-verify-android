## Running the Sample backend

### Create a Notify service
You will need a notify service to send push notifications to your app
* Go to [Push Credentials](https://www.twilio.com/console/notify/credentials)
* Click the `Add (+)` button 
* Enter a friendly name
* Select `FCM push credentials` as type
* Enter the `FCM Secret`. The value is the app's `Server key`. You can find it in your app's Firebase project settings, Cloud messaging
* Click the `Create` button
* Go to [Notify Services](https://www.twilio.com/console/notify/services)
* Create a `Notify service` for the app
* For `FCM CREDENTIAL SID`, select the created FCM credential
* Save changes
* Copy the notify service sid

### Create a verify service
* Get your account Sid and Auth Token from [API credentials](https://www.twilio.com/console/project/settings)
* Create a verify service calling the endpoint:
```
curl -X POST https://verify.twilio.com/v2/Services \
--form 'FriendlyName=Your service name' \
--form 'Push={
    "notify_service_sid": "IS00000000000000000000000000000000"
  }' \
-u ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX:your_auth_token
```
* Copy the verify service Sid, it is the `sid` field in the response

### To run the sample backend
* Clone this repo: https://github.com/twilio/verify-push-sample-backend
* Run the steps in the [README file](https://github.com/twilio/verify-push-sample-backend/blob/master/README.md)
    * Use your previously created verify service Sid for `TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID`

## Using the sample app

### Adding a factor
* Press Create factor in the factor list (main view)
* Enter the entity identity to use. This value should be an UUID that identifies the user to prevent PII information use
* Press Create factor
* Copy the factor Sid

### Sending a challenge
* Go to Create Push Challenge page (/challenge path in your sample backend)
* Enter the entity `identity` you used in factor creation
* Enter the `Factor Sid` you added
* Enter a `message`. You will see the message in the push notification and in the challenge view
* Enter details to the challenge. You will see them in the challenge view. You can add more details using the `Add more Details` button
* Press `Create challenge` button
* You will receive a push notification showing the challenge message in your device. 
* The app will show the challenge info below the factor information, in a `Challenge` section
* Approve or deny the challenge
* After the challenge is updated, you will see the challenge status in the backend's `Create Push Challenge` view
